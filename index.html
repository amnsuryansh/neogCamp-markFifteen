            Hi! I'm Java Blog!.
            I can help you giving a best visualization for Java.
        </summary>
        <p>When the world was at trouble for flexible coding, proper maintainence of written code and for modularity
            behaviour fuctionalities I was born in 1995 and was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has
            since been acquired by Oracle) .I was solely broughtup to make interactive TV's and later on Mobiles by
            using my standards.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Over 3.5 billion devices run on java.
            </p>
            <p>Andriod, Set top Boxes, Mobile devices, Symbian OS(JME), Portals where security is
                involved.</p>

        <h3>My Qualities which a programmer would say as functionalities or behaviour</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Java i.e, me . My features are</p>
            <li>High-level Language</li>
            <li>Java is Platform-Independent Language means WORA(write once and run anywhere)</li>
            <li>Java is compiled and interpreted language.</li>
            <li>Java is compiled and interpreted language.</li>
            <li>Java seprates its huge classification of predefined classes into smaller
                folders called as packages.</li>
            <li>Java has strongly built all the 5 principles of Object Orientation and
                it is the purest form of Object Oriented Programming.
                -since it is strongly built on all OOC thats what makes java highly secured.</li>
            <li>Java seprates its developers stuff into a packaged environment called
                as JDK(Java development kit) and to execute any of the code the developer
                has written he makes use of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).</li>
            <li>Jjava is simple, developer friendly, portable, highly secured and more.</li>
            <li>Java comes up with bottom to top approach which eases the way of writing the
                code.</li>
            <li>Using Java you can develop multithreaded(parallel programming) apps.</li>

        </ul>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">These features of mine can help you in making various types of applications. Such as</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Console App</li>
            <li>Stand Alone APP</li>
            <li>Enterprise or Distributed or Web Apps</li>
            <li>Micro Apps</li>
        </ol>

        For these things again I don't leave you alone.
        I have some editions which help you in various ways and provide you flexibility
        <ul>
            <li>JSE - Java's Standard Edition (Core Java) with some Advanced Stuff too.
                Core Java - OOP using Java, Programming Fundamentals using Java.
                Advanced java - MultiThreading, Error or Exception Handling, Collections F/W, JDBC, Swings & Applet(not covered)</li>
            
            <li>JEE - Java's Enterprise Edition(Java on Web or at server-side)
                Servlet, JSP, EJB, RMI, JSF.</li>
            <li>JME - Java's Micro Edition(Java on a micro platform)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You may think that I'm done....</p>
        <p>
            But no I provide my user with frameworks which are open source and offers him more functionality and
            automatic
            behaviour things and take back all additional pain of a developer and huge coding.</p>


        <p>Some open source f/ws which are written using Java</p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;"> - Hibernate , Spring , Struts, Portlets, Junit, Mockito, Selenium, Javalin, Apache POI, Andriod
            </span>
        </p>

        <div>
            Let me tell you about my JVM.
            <p><h3>JVM</h3></p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Java Virtual Machine. It provides virtualization, it is the core heart of Java which is responsible to run Java apps using interpreter.</li>
            <li>JVM does the handshake with the Operationg system and creates the virtual environment which is required for the java apps to run smoothly.</li>
            <li>It divides the meemory given by the operating system and utilizes it effectivly for managing the classes and objects in Java run time.</li>
            <li>2 popular memory is what we get to see here, STACK memory which is used as execution area and HEAP memory which is used as storage area. </li>
        </ul>
    </main>
    <div class="container">
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java is a purely Object Oriented Language.</span></p>
        The Object Oriented Programming Concepts it deals with are
        <ul>
            <li>Classes & Objects</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li> 
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
        </ul>
        <summary>But there are two main things which make it 99% OOP Language.</summary>
        <p>They are Static and Primitive types that are used in Java to make it a static programming language</p>
